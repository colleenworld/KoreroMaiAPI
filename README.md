Build an API for a chat system
Chats should be between 2 authenticated users or a group chat between 3-10 users.  More than 10 users in a chat should not be allowed
Users should be authenticated via email and password [email verification not required] and create conversations by inputting their friends’ email address
Build a simple local frontend for the chat system
Aesthetics do not count for or against you
NOTE: we’re not evaluating your CSS/design implementation.

Deliverables:

Either zip up all of the project files and deliver it to your hiring agent/the email address on the job listing, or create a git repo as outlined in the Bonuses section and let your hiring agent know/make a note of that in your email.
A document outlining any documentation, StackOverflow articles, etc must be provided.  Furthermore, any snippets of code provided by 3rd parties that you integrate must be noted with code comments
Full build instructions for both products.  Whoever evaluates your code should be able to follow your instructions and get started without any additional work

Bonuses
These items are not required as a bare minimum for submitting your test, but are highly advised.

Provide a breakdown of the User Stories that you followed to build this.
Create and commit to a git repo for your API and Frontend and send us a link 
Be able to send email notifications to users when friends join chats and/or when you receive messages - this should be executed in the background and should have provisions in place to send no more than 2 emails per second.  Don’t actually worry about sending emails, just a stub of what it would be.
Big bonus - host your live version using AWS/Azure/etc, so we can see what you can do!
Enhancements
If you are looking to go above and beyond, adding in a few features of your own would be welcome.  A few ideas could be:

In group chats, store all chat history but only show users the history from the time they joined the group onward
Allow members of group chats to leave those groups and block other members from re-adding them
Deletion of messages and chats, without deletion on the other participant’s side
Or anything else you can think of
